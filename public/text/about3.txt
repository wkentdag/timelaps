This technology is powerful, potentially for good as well as bad. With Timelaps, we don’t aim to pass judgement on a trend which we’re all responsible for and beholden to. Instead, we would like to expose our shifting scope of reality through juxtaposition. Bodies of water, with their organic rhythms and illusion of infiniteness, demonstrate the sublime grandeur of nature. Moon tides, waves, and underwater ecosystems connote complex physical and biological reactions beyond our control. A lake - by definition - is encompassed by land, a finite space, as opposed to the unending expanse of the sea. Our encounter with a lake is predicated by this definition, which explains the jarring effect of visiting Lake Superior and encountering what appears to be an infinite plain, expanding into an unknown horizon. The lake overwhelms our sense of space and time. What, if anything, is lost from this experience when we filter it through our 21st century digital reality? Timelaps attempts to provide an answer by presenting a hypermediated Lake Superior: reduced to data points and filtered through algorithms, digitally translated and reduced to its most basic elements - light and sound.
