While this effect is no doubt profound, it is also nothing new. What we aim to expose with Timelaps is another, more abstract evolution. While the (potentially worrying) effects of the internet and social media have been chronicled ad nauseum, it is the explosion of smartphones in recent years that has created a new paradigm for reality. As the recent Snowden revelations have demonstrated, there are serious biopolitical implications for being constantly “logged in.” However, on a more personal level, portable internet is shrinking our day-to-day scope even more than basic human infrastructure has. The distinction between on- and off-line has been erased. The constant internet access offered by our mobiles is alluring, and as we inevitably gravitate towards it, we delegate more and more of our existence to modifications and prescriptions produced by computers and algorithms. Our lives become defined by micro-level digital jargon: server response times, download speed, microprocessors, routers…in short, artificial indexes all but divorced from anything physical or tangible.
