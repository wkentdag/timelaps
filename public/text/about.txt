Timelaps is a dynamic projection-based artwork that explores our changing relationship to the digital and the natural. Timelaps combines a live video stream of Lake Superior with a sonic environment that musically expresses the lakeâ€™s changing weather conditions over time in order to contrast the two temporalities and meditate on conceptions of nature, temporality, fidelity, and mediated experience. As our day-to-day lives become increasingly digitally based, we experience mediation on a more frequent basis than ever. This fact becomes clear when we experience the grandeur of nature, whose temporality (geologic eras and tides) seems to overwhelm the relatively fleeting scale of the digital (download speed and webpage loading times).
