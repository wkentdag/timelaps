Timelaps is a dynamic installation that explores our rapidly shifting relationship with the natural world. At its base, the earth’s surface is a massive combination of elements that coalesce into a topology with which we’re familiar: oceans, mountains, sand, dirt, etc. Human technology has radically transformed this surface, to the point that the presence of any uninhibited “nature” in an urban area is startling amid a carefully constructed sea of asphalt, concrete, and manicured greenery. This compartmentalization of our world serves to shrink the scope of our day-to-day lives; instead of thinking of distance in terms of continents or even cities we use miles, blocks, or - typically - the number of minutes or hours it would take to move from place to place, time as a spatial metaphor.
