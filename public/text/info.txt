<p>Timelaps is a digital audio-visual recreation of the sights and sounds of Lake Superior, created using Max/MSP and Python. The installation comprises continuous four-channel audio and video programmatically generated in Max/MSP, with a Python program feeding it live weather data from the lake. </p>

<p> The data is published by NOAA’s <a href=‘http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/'>National Data Buoy Center</a>. Every ten minutes, Timelaps pulls a newly updated three month’s worth of weather data from four buoys spread across the lake (# <a href=‘http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=45006'>45006</a>, <a href=‘http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=45001'>45001</a>, <a href=‘http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=KP53'>KP53</a>, and <a href=‘http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=KP59'>KP59</a>), representing a snapshot of the conditions at that moment in that area of the lake. Max reads through the data (which has several entries per minute), at a rate that fluctuates in accordance with the number of visitors at the installation and their amount of movement. Max generates an ambient tune which reacts according to fluctuations in the weather, with each of the four audio channels representing a buoy and its distinct data. Wind direction controls the song’s key, and wind speed adjusts a filter (creating a ‘whooshing’ effect); similarly, air pressure adds and adjusts a delay on its audio, with fluctuating air temperature change each note’s decay. Ideally, the piece will move slowly with few visitors, fleshing out quick changes  in a day’s weather (clouds moving over the lake causing the temperature to drop, a gust of wind, etc). With many visitors, Timelaps cycles through weeks’ worth of weather in a few moments, allowing the changing seasons’ more gradual weather shifts to become apparent. Combined with continuous video footage of the lake’s horizon, Timelaps presents a digitally rendered visit to Lake Superior.
